# SQL Queries

Here you're find some of the many SQL queries I regularly wrote to insert, pull, and manipulate data from a database with hundreds of thousands of records. Below are a few examples that demonstrate some of my range with a variety of SQL tasks.

**Note:** All SQL Queries are written to operate in MS SQL Server.

**The Task:** To pull data on all properties in the listing phase. This data is used to insert and update an automated dashboard I created in Excel that is sent to company partners and senior management.
