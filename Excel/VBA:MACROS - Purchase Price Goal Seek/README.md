# Purchase Price Goal Seek Macro

**The Task:** Take a simple task performed in Excel 40+ times a day, one that takes several clicks and approximations, wasting up to a minute each iterance, and turn it into an automated 1-push macro. 

**Highlighted Abilities:** Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Macros, Excel's Goal Seek Function

**Further Explaination:** This macro adjusts the value of an investment's purchase price, in turn manipulating the investment's base-case AROI, until it reachs 10%. This percentage can be easily adjusted within the macro depending on market conditions. Afterwards, it then rounds up the purchase price into a number in the thousands, which we use in an offer. 

Previously this purchase price value would be found by roughly approximating it, several grand up and down at a time. This would be performed until we reached a value close enough to 10% AROI that we were satisified. While this task typically doesn't take more than a minute or two, it's performed over 40 times a day, causing this macro to save a minimum of a half an hour of productivity time per day.
