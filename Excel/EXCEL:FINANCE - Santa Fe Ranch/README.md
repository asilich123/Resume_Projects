# Santa Fe Ranch Explaination

**The Task:** Given a **time limit of 6 hours**, I was tasked with researching market data, making local growth assumptions, writing up a pitch summary, and creating **this entire pro forma from scratch**. 

**Highlighted Skills:** Commercial Real Estate Finance, Market Research, Excel's Financial Functions, and Creating an Automated Summary Dashboard, a Full Pro Forma, a Unit Mix Table, a Sensitivity Table, and an Amoritization Table under a time constraint. 

**Notes:** Instructions provided to me are found within "SFR Instructions". The case specific details provided for the investment opportunity are found within "SFR Offer Memorandum". 

My delievered final products are "SFR Excel Pro Forma" and "SFR Summary Letter".
