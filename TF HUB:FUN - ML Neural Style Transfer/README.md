# TensorFlow Hub Neural Style Transfer

**The Task:** Explored TensorFlow Hub by using a pretrained neural network module, Magenta Image Style Transfer, to transfer the art style of art pieces to other photographs. 

**Highlighted Abilities:** TF Hub, Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, MatplotLib, Jupyter, and an understanding of Tensors, Arrays, and basic ML Computer Vision.

**Notes:** Feel free to download and play around with it yourself. The file contains descriptive documentation that'll walk you through how it works and how to create your own style transfered images. 

Check below for style transfer examples!
