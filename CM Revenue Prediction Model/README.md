# Capital Markets Revenue Prediction Model

**Highlighted Abilities:** Python, Time Series Predictive Analysis, XGBoost, LightGBM, HyperOpt, MLFlow, Statistics

**Description:** Built a time series forecasting model to predict Capital Markets monthly income. 
  Cross-validated between multiple models (SARIMA, TBATS, XGBoost, LightGBM). 
  Settled on a hybrid tree-based model that I featured engineered in economic trend and lagged delta and moving average data. 
  Used Hyperopt Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization with a custom expanding window objective function to minimize loss. 
  Improved the previous model's average prediction error from 24.79% to 3.96%
