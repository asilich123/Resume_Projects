# Red Bull Excel Dashboard

For this project I was tasked with creating two visually appealing dashboards given a data set and a mapping table that needed to be index-matched together.

This project highlights my abilities with pivot tables, slicers, Excel dashboard visualization, and index-match functions.

Specific directions for this case study are included in the 3rd worksheet within the Excel workbook.
