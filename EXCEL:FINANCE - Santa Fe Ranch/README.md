**Task:** Given a **time limit of 6 hours**, I was tasked with researching market data, making local growth assumptions, writing up a pitch summary, and creating **this entire pro forma from scratch**. 

**Demonstrated Skills:** Commercial Real Estate Finance, Market Research, Excel Financial Functions, Creating an Automated Summary Dashboard, a Full Pro Forma, a Unit Mix Table, a Sensitivity Table, and an Amoritization Table under a time constraint.
