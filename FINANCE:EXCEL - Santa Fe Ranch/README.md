## Santa Fe Ranch Explaination

Given a **time limit of 6 hours** after receiving the included case study materials, I was tasked with researching market data, making local growth assumptions, writing up a pitch summary, and creating this entire pro forma **from scratch**. 

While the final product isn't perfectly polished, it demonstrates my financial knowledge, market research abilities, and Excel pro forma modeling skills under a time constraint.

Specifics instructions provided to me regarding the case study are found within "SFR Instructions". The case specific details provided for the investment opportunity are found within "SFR Offer Memorandum". 

My delievered final products are "SFR Excel Pro Forma" and "SFR Summary Letter".
