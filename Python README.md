Here you'll find projects that demonstrate my skills with Python as well as some of its various modules such as Pandas, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, and MatplotLib. 


## Neural Network Style Transfer - Los Angeles City Scape Collage
The Task: Explored the TensorFlow Hub by using a pretrained neural network module, Magenta Image Style Transfer, to transfer the art style of specific pieces to other photographs.

Highlighted Abilities: TF Hub, Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, MatplotLib, Jupyter, and an understanding of Tensors, Arrays, and basic ML Computer Vision.

Notes: Check out the project folder for additional project details and collage demonstrations.
