# TensorFlow Hub Neural Style Transfer

**Highlighted Abilities:** TF Hub, Python, TensorFlow, Numpy, and Computer Vision.

**Description:** Imported a pre-trained neural network, Magenta Image Style Transfer, from the TensorFlow Hub, a community similar to Hugging Face. Flattened
  images and used Magenta to transfer the art style of one piece onto another. <br> <br>
  Load neural network -> flatten images into 3 color channel 32bit numpy arrays -> feed model -> squeeze back into image format
