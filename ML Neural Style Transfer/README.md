# TensorFlow Hub Neural Style Transfer

**The Task:** Explored the TensorFlow Hub by using a pretrained neural network module, Magenta Image Style Transfer, to transfer the art style of specific pieces to other photographs. 

**Highlighted Abilities:** TF Hub, Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, MatplotLib, Jupyter, and an understanding of Tensors, Arrays, and basic ML Computer Vision.

**Notes:** Feel free to download and play around with it yourself. The file contains hand-written descriptive documentation that'll walk you through how it works and how to create your own style transferred images. 

Check below for style transfer examples!
