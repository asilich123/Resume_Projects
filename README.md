# Hello and Welcome !!

Within the walls of this directory contain projects that demonstrate some of the many skills highlighted in my resume. Some of these projects were done for fun, some for education, and some for business. 

Within each subdirectory you will find a short explaination of the project, my skills demonstrated, and any additional notes I thought were relevant. Below you'll find a quick photo copy of my resume in case you would like a refresher. 

Enjoy :grin: !
