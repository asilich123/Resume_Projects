# Building a Neural Network With Only Numpy

**Highlighted Abilities:** Python, Numpy, Neural Networks, Deep Learning Architecture, Basic Computer Vision

**Description:** Built a gradient descent neural network with forward and back propagation using only vanilla Python and Numpy. Network featured 3 hidden layers that used a ReLU activation function. Applied network to the traditional MNIST and fashion MNIST classifiers for 500 epochs. 

Traditional MNIST achieved train/test accuracy of 90.54%/90.48% respectively <br>
Fashion MNIST achieved train/test accuracy of 80.59%/80.31% respectively
