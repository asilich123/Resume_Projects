# Building a Neural Network from Scratch

**Highlighted Abilities:** Python, Numpy, Neural Networks, Computer Vision

**Description:** Built a neural network from scratch using numpy. Tested a vanilla neural network on the Fashion MNIST classifier to pull a list of weights. Created a forward propagation model with the set weights. Afterwards, developed hidden layers with back propagation in order to train the networks own weights.
